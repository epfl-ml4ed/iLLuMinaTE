       "'### Report on Student Performance Analysis\\n\\n#### 1. Identification of Exogenous and Endogenous Variables\\n\\n**Exogenous Variables:**\\n- **delay_lecture:** This is an external factor as it depends on the release schedule of the lectures.\\n- **ratio_clicks_weekend_day:** This ratio depends on the student\\'s personal schedule and preference for studying on weekends versus weekdays.\\n- **total_clicks:** The overall engagement of the student, which is influenced by personal motivation and interest.\\n- **total_clicks_problem:** This is influenced by the number of problems available and the student\\'s willingness to engage with them.\\n- **total_clicks_video:** Similar to total_clicks_problem, this is influenced by the availability of video content and the student\\'s engagement.\\n- **student_speed:** This is influenced by the student\\'s individual pace of learning and problem-solving.\\n- **number_sessions:** This is influenced by the student\\'s study habits and time management.\\n\\n**Endogenous Variables:**\\n- **competency_strength:** This is determined by the student\\'s ability to pass quizzes with high grades and few attempts, which is influenced by their understanding of the material and preparation.\\n- **competency_alignment:** This is determined by the number of problems the student has passed, which is influenced by their engagement and understanding.\\n- **content_alignment:** This is determined by the number of videos watched, influenced by the student\\'s engagement with the course material.\\n- **regularity_periodicity_m1:** This is influenced by the student\\'s study habits and consistency.\\n- **time_sessions_mean, time_sessions_sum, time_sessions_std:** These are influenced by the student\\'s overall study time and the consistency of their study sessions.\\n- **time_in__problem_sum:** This is influenced by the student\\'s engagement with problem-solving activities.\\n- **time_in__video_sum:** This is influenced by the student\\'s engagement with video content.\\n\\n#### 2. Explanation Based on Pearl’s Model of Explanation\\n\\n**Minimal Set of Factors:**\\nThe minimal set of factors that are crucial for explaining the student\\'s predicted success (\"pass\") includes:\\n- **competency_strength_InWeek4** (0.4928404928404929)\\n- **total_clicks_problem_InWeek5** (0.1314474998685525)\\n- **time_in__problem_sum_InWeek5** (0.3285718599568027)\\n- **regularity_periodicity_m1_InWeek5** (0.2554147429399847)\\n\\n**Factors to Improve:**\\nFrom the data, the following features negatively contribute to the student’s success and should be improved:\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek5** (0.0)\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek4** (0.0)\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek3** (0.0)\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek2** (0.0)\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek1** (0.0)\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek5** (0.0)\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek4** (0.0)\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek3** (0.0)\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek2** (0.0)\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek1** (0.0)\\n- **student_shape_InWeek3** (0.0)\\n- **student_shape_InWeek4** (0.0)\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\nThe student’s predicted success is largely influenced by their **competency_strength** in Week 4, which indicates a strong understanding and performance in quizzes with few attempts. This suggests that the student has a solid grasp of the material covered in Week 4, which is crucial for their success in the course.\\n\\nAdditionally, the **total_clicks_problem_InWeek5** and **time_in__problem_sum_InWeek5** are significant indicators of the student\\'s engagement with problem-solving activities in Week 5. This engagement is essential for mastering the skills and topics covered in Week 5, such as Ideal Filters and Filter Design.\\n\\nThe **regularity_periodicity_m1_InWeek5** indicates that the student has a consistent study pattern, which contributes positively to their predicted success.\\n\\nHowever, there are areas that need improvement:\\n- **Competency_alignment** across all weeks is 0.0, indicating that the student has not passed any problems in those weeks. This suggests a lack of engagement or difficulty in solving problems, which needs to be addressed.\\n- **Competency_anticipation** is also 0.0 across all weeks, indicating that the student is not preparing for future quizzes, which could hinder their understanding and performance in upcoming topics.\\n- **Student_shape** in Weeks 3 and 4 is 0.0, indicating that the student is not achieving maximum quiz grades on the first attempt, suggesting a need for better preparation or understanding.\\n\\n#### Recommendations:\\n1. **Increase Engagement with Problems:**\\n   - Encourage the student to actively engage with problem-solving activities in all weeks to improve their competency alignment.\\n   \\n2. **Improve Preparation for Future Quizzes:**\\n   - Motivate the student to anticipate and prepare for future quizzes to enhance their competency anticipation.\\n\\n3. **Consistent Study Habits:**\\n   - Maintain and possibly improve the student\\'s regularity in study habits to ensure consistent performance.\\n\\n4. **Focus on Understanding Material:**\\n   - Provide additional resources or tutoring to help the student understand the material better, especially in Weeks 3 and 4, to improve their student shape.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, the student can improve their overall performance and increase their chances of success in the course.'"

       " AIMessage(content=\"### Student Performance Analysis Report\\n\\n#### Model Prediction\\n- **Prediction**: Fail\\n- **Confidence**: 99.970371%\\n\\n#### Key Features Influencing Prediction\\nBased on the CEM Counterfactuals and LIME analysis, the following features were identified as important for the student's prediction of failure:\\n\\n1. **total_clicks_problem_InWeek5** - 0.220159\\n2. **time_in__problem_sum_InWeek5** - 0.169638\\n3. **total_clicks_problem_InWeek4** - 0.084454\\n4. **total_clicks_weekend_InWeek5** - 0.083752\\n5. **competency_strength_InWeek5** - 0.076904\\n6. **total_clicks_InWeek5** - 0.018523\\n7. **student_speed_InWeek5** - 0.009943\\n8. **regularity_periodicity_m1_InWeek5** - 0.003961\\n9. **competency_anticipation_InWeek1** - 0.000000\\n10. **competency_strength_InWeek1** - 0.000000\\n\\n#### Relevant Feature Values\\nThe LIME analysis provided the following feature values for the student, which are critical in understanding their performance:\\n\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n- **competency_strength_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek4**: 0.0\\n- **total_clicks_problem_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n- **competency_strength_InWeek4**: 0.0\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek3**: 0.0\\n- **student_shape_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n- **total_clicks_problem_InWeek4**: 0.0\\n- **time_between_sessions_std_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n- **competency_alignment_InWeek2**: 0.0\\n- **competency_strength_InWeek3**: 0.0\\n- **total_clicks_weekend_InWeek4**: 0.0\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n- **time_in__problem_sum_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek4**: 0.0\\n- **student_shape_InWeek2**: 0.0\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek2**: 0.0\\n- **competency_anticipation_InWeek3**: 0.0\\n- **student_speed_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n- **regularity_periodicity_m1_InWeek5**: 0.0\\n\\n#### Analysis and Recommendations\\n\\n1. **Low Engagement with Problem Sets**:\\n   - The student has not engaged with problem sets in Week 4 and Week 5 as indicated by the feature values `total_clicks_problem_InWeek4` and `total_clicks_problem_InWeek5` being 0. This lack of interaction is critical since problem-solving is essential for mastering the concepts in the Digital Signal Processing 1 course.\\n\\n2. **Minimal Time Spent on Problem Solving**:\\n   - The feature `time_in__problem_sum_InWeek5` is 0, indicating the student has not spent any time on problem-solving activities in Week 5. This could significantly impact their understanding and application of the course material.\\n\\n3. **Competency Strength and Alignment**:\\n   - The features `competency_strength_InWeek5` and `competency_alignment_InWeek5` are both 0, indicating that the student has not demonstrated strong competency or alignment with the course objectives in Week 5. This suggests a need for targeted interventions to improve their grasp of the material.\\n\\n4. **Weekend Activity**:\\n   - The student has not engaged in any course-related activities during weekends as indicated by `total_clicks_weekend_InWeek5` being 0. Encouraging weekend study sessions could help the student catch up with the course material.\\n\\n5. **Overall Clicks and Engagement**:\\n   - The overall engagement, as measured by `total_clicks_InWeek5`, is very low (0.018523). This suggests that the student is not actively participating in the course activities, which is a significant factor contributing to the prediction of failure.\\n\\n6. **Regularity and Speed**:\\n   - The features `regularity_periodicity_m1_InWeek5` and `student_speed_InWeek5` being 0 indicate a lack of consistent study patterns and possibly inefficient use of study time.\\n\\n#### Recommendations for Improvement\\n\\n1. **Increase Engagement with Problem Sets**:\\n   - The student should be encouraged to actively participate in problem-solving activities. Specific strategies could include setting aside dedicated time for problem sets and seeking help from instructors or peers when needed.\\n\\n2. **Allocate Time for Studying on Weekends**:\\n   - Encouraging the student to use weekends for catching up on missed content and reinforcing their understanding could be beneficial.\\n\\n3. **Regular Study Schedule**:\\n   - Establishing a regular study schedule that includes consistent daily study times could help improve the student's regularity and engagement with the course material.\\n\\n4. **Utilize Available Resources**:\\n   - The student should be encouraged to take advantage of all available resources, including office hours, discussion forums, and study groups.\\n\\n5. **Monitor Progress and Provide Feedback**:\\n   - Regular monitoring of the student's progress and providing timely feedback can help identify areas of difficulty early and address them promptly.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, the student may improve their understanding and performance in the Digital Signal Processing 1 course, potentially changing their predicted outcome from failure to success.\")]"
